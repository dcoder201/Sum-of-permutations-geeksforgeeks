-------------------------------------

Given N distinct digits in an array A (from 1 to 9), Your task is to complete the function getSum which finds sum of all n digit numbers that can be formed using these digits. 

Note: Since the output can be large take modulo 1000000007

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N . In the next line are N space separated digits.

Output:
For each test case in a new line output will be the sum of all n digit numbers that can be formed using these digits.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=9

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
3
1 2 3
2
1 2
Output:
1332
33

Explanation:
For first test case
the numbers formed will be 123 , 132 , 312 , 213, 231 , 321
sum = 123 + 132 + 312 + 213 + 231 + 321 = 1332

For second test case
the numbers formed will be 12, 21
sum = 12 + 21 = 33
